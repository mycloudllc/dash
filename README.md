This is a fork of https://github.com/openDsh/dash!

While the original project is great, there is some custom modifications tailered especially towards the Raspberry Pi 4. 
While it may be compatable with other Pi boards or sbcs, it is not guaranteed.
As with the original project this is alpha software, and is a current work in progress. Scripts may break and may have irreversable changes, so use at your own risk.
I will try to keep this project as updated to the original project as I can, any help is welcome.

Huge shoutout to the original developers @icecube45 and @rsjudka!
